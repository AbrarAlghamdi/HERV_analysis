# HERV_analysis
This repository contains scripts and resources for analyzing the expression of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) using RNA-seq data.
and a python script to automatically Download public RNA-seq data

## System and Tools Used

All code development and data analysis were performed on a **Linux Mint 20.3** system.  
- **Bowtie2** version **2.5.4** was used for aligning reads to the reference genome.  
- **Samtools** version **1.21** was used for sorting and indexing the alignment files.  
- **Telescope** version **1.0.3** was employed for transcript quantification.
- **R** version **4.5.0** was used for data analysis.  
- To generate simulated RNA-seq reads, we used the R package **`polyester`**,
